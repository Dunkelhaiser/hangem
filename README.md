## About The Project

Hangem is a simple hangman game built with React, TanStack Router, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. Words are randomly generated using Faker.js across various categories, and you can also create your own word and obtain a unique URL to share with others. Your completed words are saved in history. It has a clean paper-like UI with support for light and dark modes. It also has PWA support.
